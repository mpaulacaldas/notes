# Launching Sublime Text 3 from the command line

I followed the instructions from [this blog post](http://olivierlacan.com/posts/launch-sublime-text-3-from-the-command-line/) by [@olivierlacan](https://twitter.com/olivierlacan).

To open a project in the current directory:

```
sublime .
```

To open a new or existing file in the current directory:

```
sublime "hello.txt"
```
