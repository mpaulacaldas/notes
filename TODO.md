# TODO

- [ ] Read [this](https://sandhya-k.gitbooks.io/on-boarding-off-boarding-in-newsrooms/content/links.html) for links on documentation/onboarding.

- [ ] Read up on Airbnb's [Knowledge Repo](http://knowledge-repo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and check out this [R package](https://github.com/dgrtwo/knowledgerepo).

- [ ] Read or listen to _[Causal inference: The mix tape](http://scunning.com/stata.html)_. Seems to have good Stata resources.

- [ ] Check out the [antitrust](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/antitrust/antitrust.pdf) and [trade](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/trade/trade.pdf) CRAN packages.
