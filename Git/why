# Why should we use Github at work?

## Pitch


### To the company

- Why we need Github
- How it is used in industry
- How it is used by other teams at the company
    - Domestic teams
    - International teams
- Why our team needs to use it
- Address security concerns
- Cost

### To my boss

In addition to the above:

- What is version control?
- Why do we need version control?
- Collaboration with Github
- Uses
    - [Documentation](https://github.com/INN/docs)
    - Code reviews
    - [Tutorials](https://github.com/Satalia/production-data-science)
- Concrete examples of where we could use it

## Training

### For the entire team (non-coders included)

Explain version control and the vocabulary:
- Commit
- Diff
- Master
- Branch
- Push/Pull (possibly unnecessary)
- Pull request (possibly unnecessary)

Concentrate on practical exercises. Focus is on collaboration:
- Make them go to the tutorial repo, explain what a README is
- In an issue, ask a question and have participants:
    - Vote with emojis, give two options
    - Reply
    - Mention others with @
- Have them fork the repo.
- Have them read a `help-wanted` issue, where there is a checklist with small changes that need to be made to a file. Have them implement the changes in their own repo.
    - Fix a typo
    - Put something in bold
    - Something in italics
    - Headers
    - Add code formatting inline
    - Add code formatting to chunk
    - Add R syntax highlighting
    - Strikethrough
    - Create bullet list
    - Fill out a table
    - Insert a quote
    - Refer to an issue
    - Add link to [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) cheatsheet
    - Add a link to the emoji cheatsheet: https://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/
    - Add link to the README
    - Add link to another section in the same document
- Ask them to go back to the original repo.
- Pick one person to do a change in the README, show how it works to create a branch and start a pull request.
- Ask someone to create a new issue for feedback
    - Strive for a good title! (e.g. Feedback from YYYY-MM-DD session)
    - Add appropriate tag
- Ask them to create a new issue for us to vote on the tags that we should have. Here are my first suggestions:
    - `bug`
    - `feature`
    - `urgent`
    - `help-wanted`
- Show them how to create a new repo

Leave them with some fun examples:
  - [Getting help arranging vacations](https://github.com/dylanegan/travel#planning)
  - [Legal documents to help startups](https://github.com/seriesseed/equity)
