# Github pages

You can host HTML files in Github via Github Pages. The steps to follow are:

1. Create a branch named gh-pages

  ```bash
  git checkout --orphan gh-pages
  ```

1. Remove everything but the HTML file of interest. For `bookdown` books, this will be `index.html`.
    - If you are hosting a `bookdown` book, keep all of the images, CSS and JavaScript files.
    - If you are hosting self-contained slides generated with RMarkdown, you should **remove** all other files.

  ```bash
  ls | grep -v slides.html | parallel rm
  ```

1. If this is not already the case, rename the HTML `index.html`.

  ```shell
  mv slides.html index.html
  ```

1. Add a hidden file that tells Github not to build the site via Jekyll.

  ```bash
  touch .nojekyll
  ```

1. Stage, commit and push.

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add webpage"
  git push origin gh-pages
  ```
