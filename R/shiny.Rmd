## Leaflet

- I cannot reuse the same output binding (e.g. from a leaflet plot) in different tab panels. There are two possible solutions: use modules, or do a double assignment. For more info see [this issue](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/issues/867).
- I need to store clicks from a leaflet map. The [documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/shiny.html) and [this answer form SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41106547/how-to-save-click-events-in-leaflet-shiny-map) were useful.
- This [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41104576/changing-styles-when-selecting-and-deselecting-multiple-polygons-with-leaflet-sh/41147206#41147206) explains how to use clicks and double clicks to update a Leaflet map.

## Modules

[Link to article.](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html)

#### Context

- Input and output IDs must be unique across the entire app. Modules only require  input and output IDs to be unique _within the function_.
- When to use Shiny modules? When you want functions to generate UI, inputs and outputs.
- A module = piece of UI + fragment of server logic that uses that UI

#### How to use them

Module UI functions need to:
- have names suffixed with `Input`, `Ouput` or `UI`
- have `id` as __first__ argument
- create a namespace function at the beginning of the statement like so: `ns <- NS(id)`
- wrap any input or output ID in `ns()`
- wrap results in `tagList()`

They look more or less like this:
```r
fooInput <- function(id, label = "Label") {
  # Create namespace
  ns <- NS(id)

  # Wrap result in tagList()
  tagList(

    # Creating inputs
    # Make sure they are wraped by ns()

    )

}
```

Module server functions need to:

- be named like their corresponding module UI function but _without_ the `Input`, `Ouput` or `UI` suffix
- have `input`, `output` and `session` as its first parameters

They look more or less like this:

```r
foo <- function(input, output, session, ...) {
  # Stuff calling on the IDs created in fooInput()
}
```

Bring it all together:

- `global.R`: source the script where you have saved your module functions
- `ui.R`: call the module UI function pretty much like you would with any other input function

```r
fooInput("id_foo", "This is a label")
```

- `server.R`: call the server function, making sure you have the same ID

```r
callModule(foo, "id_foo", ...)
```
