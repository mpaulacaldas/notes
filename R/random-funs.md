# Useful but not regularly used functions

- [`pryr::object_size()`](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/memory.html)


# New finds

- [`dplyr::pull()`](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pull.html) to pull out a variable from a tibble as a vector. Same the thing as `... %>% .$varname`, but perhaps more stylish.
