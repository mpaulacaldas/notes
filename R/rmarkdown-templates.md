# R Markdown templates

R Markdown templates can be included in packages:

- I learned about this possibility from watching [Daniel Hadley](https://twitter.com/danielphadley)'s talk at rstudio::conf2018 on _Branding and automating your work with R Markdown_. 
  - [Slides](https://github.com/Sorenson-Impact/rmarkdown-branding-talk)

  - [Package](https://github.com/Sorenson-Impact/sorensonimpact)
- It seems like [Chester Ismay](https://twitter.com/old_man_chester) had already written a pretty nice [blog post](http://ismayc.github.io/ecots2k16/template_pkg/)about _Creating a basic template package in R_.
