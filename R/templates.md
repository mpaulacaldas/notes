# R templates

## R Markdown templates

R Markdown templates can be included in packages:

- I learned about this possibility from watching [Daniel Hadley](https://twitter.com/danielphadley)'s talk at rstudio::conf2018 on _Branding and automating your work with R Markdown_.
  - [Slides](https://github.com/Sorenson-Impact/rmarkdown-branding-talk)
  - [Video](https://youtu.be/ogy7rHWlsQ8?t=5h55m27s)
  - [Package](https://github.com/Sorenson-Impact/sorensonimpact)
- It seems like [Chester Ismay](https://twitter.com/old_man_chester) had already written a pretty nice [blog post](http://ismayc.github.io/ecots2k16/template_pkg/)about _Creating a basic template package in R_.

## R Project templates

- See [this thread](https://discuss.ropensci.org/t/resources-on-project-directory-organization/340) from [Noam Ross](https://twitter.com/noamross) for links about data analysis project organisation.
