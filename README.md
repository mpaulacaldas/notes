# Notes :notebook:
This is my attempt at keeping track of the things I learn.

To encourage myself to do this regularly, I will keep a [daily log](daily-log.md) file where I will write down 1-2 new things each day. These little notes will _hopefully_ later be sorted into one of the neat little categories below.

Every once in a while, I should also try to cross stuff off my :point_right: [TODO](TODO.md) :point_left:
