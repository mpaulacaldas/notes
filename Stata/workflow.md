# Workflow and good practices

- Packages for generating LaTeX output from Stata code. [Website](https://lukestein.github.io/stata-latex-workflows/) [Github](https://github.com/lukestein/stata-latex-workflows) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lukestein/status/1097996795236372480)

- I _should_ be able to run Stata commands in .Rmd files by changing the chuck option from `{r}` to `{stata}`. This doesn't work for me, I am not really sure why. The method described in this [blog post](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~hemken/SASworkshops/Markdown/SASmarkdown.html) (for SAS) did work. I should explore further.
