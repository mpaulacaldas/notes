# Workflow and good practices

- [The Do's and Don't of a Do file](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/docs/yin-remi/do-file.pdf).
- [SDP Toolkit](https://hwpi.harvard.edu/files/sdp/files/sdp-toolkit-coding-style-guide.pdf).
- [Top 10 Stata 'gotchas'](https://www.ifs.org.uk/docs/stata_gotchasJan2014.pdf).
- I _should_ be able to run Stata commands in .Rmd files by changing the chuck option from `{r}` to `{stata}`. This doesn't work for me, I am not really sure why. The method described in this [blog post](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~hemken/SASworkshops/Markdown/SASmarkdown.html) (for SAS) did work. I should explore further.
